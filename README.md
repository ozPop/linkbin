# Linkbin <sup>_Annotate your links_</sup>

#### Flatiron Web Fellowship Summer 2016, Sinatra Assessment by Ozzie Popovas

The purpose of this project was to create a simple sinatra based application that provides an interface to store links while also allowing the user to:

* Select or create categories
* Add a description
* Add a comment

Other notes:

* The application uses Postgres as its database
* It is being optimized for mobile usage
* Parts of code have been borrowed from the web
    * Sources can be found in application files

Future improvements:

* Inputs should persist upon validation triggers
    * signup page
    * new and update forms
* Add link validation to new and edit forms
* Add filtering of categories when displaying items
* Add searching through categories
* Add Captcha at signup
* Each user should have their own list of categories
* Long category display needs improvement
    * On notes long category names shouldnt overlap note bounds
    * In forms long category names shouldnt overlap the box

P.S. This is a work in progress
